## 👨‍💻 About Me

Hi! I'm **Parteek Mittal**, an enthusiastic and self-driven developer passionate about solving problems through code. I specialize in **C++** and **Data Structures & Algorithms**, and I'm currently expanding my skills into **full-stack web development**.

I'm a strong believer in consistent learning and love contributing to collaborative projects that reflect real-world use cases. I'm actively solving DSA problems on platforms like Leetcode and GFG.

Currently, I'm:
- 🚀 Learning backend tech **Node.js**, **Express**, and **SQL**
- 🧠 Practicing competitive programming and interview-style problems
- 🔧 Exploring version control workflows and team collaboration via Git/GitHub

I'm open to collaborating on meaningful tech projects, especially those that challenge my understanding and push me to grow as a developer.
